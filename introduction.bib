Topics examined include the origin of stellar masses; bimodal SF; initial mass functions; binary stars, bound clusters, and hierarchical fragmentation; and the efficiency of SF. The properties of molecular clouds and the origin of substructures in molecular clumps are explored in detail, and consideration is given to gravitational collapse and protostars, bipolar outflows from young stellar objects, visible young stellar objects, and the implications for binary-star and

The line emission reflects the temperature distribution within the disks and not the mass distribution as previously suggested. The (C-13)O line fluxes from the HL Tau and two similar stars show that the outer disk temperatures are, indeed, higher than expected for normal accretion disks, as inferred from far-infrared continuum data. The line radiation indicates that the disks are at least 400 AU in extent. The very high optical depths in the CO lines imply that as little as 6 x 10 exp -6 solar mass of gas may be detected around very young stars with existing instrumentation.},

  abstract = {We review current understanding of star formation, outlining an overall theoretical framework and the observations that motivate it. A
conception of star formation has emerged in which turbulence plays a dual role, both creating overdensities to initiate gravitational contraction or collapse, and countering the effects of gravity in these overdense regions. The key dynamical processes involved in star
formation{\textemdash}turbulence, magnetic fields, and self-gravity{\textemdash}are
highly nonlinear and multidimensional. Physical arguments are used to identify and explain the features and scalings involved in star
formation, and results from numerical simulations are used to quantify these effects. We divide star formation into large-scale and small-scale regimes and review each in turn. Large scales range from galaxies to giant molecular clouds (GMCs) and their substructures. Important problems include how GMCs form and evolve, what determines the star formation rate (SFR), and what determines the initial mass function (IMF). Small scales range from dense cores to the protostellar systems they beget. We discuss formation of both low- and high-mass stars, including ongoing accretion. The development of winds and outflows is increasingly well understood, as are the mechanisms governing angular momentum transport in disks. Although outstanding questions remain, the framework is now in place to build a comprehensive theory of star formation that will be tested by the next generation of telescopes.},

  abstract = {We present Owens Valley Radio Observatory Millimeter Array \ensuremath{\lambda}=3.4-1.2 mm dust continuum and spectral line observations of the accretion disk encircling the T Tauri star LkCa 15. The 1.2 mm dust continuum emission is resolved and gives a minimum diameter of 190 AU and an inclination angle of 57deg+/-5deg. There is a noticeable but, at present, poorly constrained decrease in the continuum spectral slope with frequency that may result from the coupled processes of grain growth and dust settling. Imaging of the fairly intense emission from the lowest rotational transitions of CO,
13CO, and HCO+ reveals a rotating disk
substantially larger than that observed in the dust continuum. Emission extends to {\textasciitilde}750 AU and the characteristic radius of the disk is
determined to be {\textasciitilde}425 AU (HWHM), based on model fits to the CO velocity field. The measured line ratios demonstrate that the emission from these species is optically thick, while that from C18O and
H13CO+ is optically thin, or nearly so. The disk mass derived from the CO isotopologues with typical dense cloud
abundances is still nearly 2 orders of magnitude less than that inferred from the dust emission, the most probable explanation being extensive molecular depletion in the cold, dense disk midplane. Thus, while CO, HCO+, and their isotopologues are excellent tracers of the disk velocity field, they are not reliable tracers of the disk mass. N2H+ 1--\ensuremath{>}0 emission has also been detected which, along with HCO+, sets a lower limit to the fractional ionization of 10-8 in the near-surface regions of
protoplanetary disks. This first detection of N2H+ in circumstellar disks has also made possible a determination of the N2/CO ratio ({\textasciitilde}2) that is at least an order of magnitude larger than those in the envelopes of young stellar objects and dense clouds. The large N2/CO ratio indicates that our observations probe disk layers in which CO is depleted but some N2 remains in the gas phase. Such differential depletion can lead to large
variations in the fractional ionization with height in the outer reaches of circumstellar disks and may help to explain the relative nitrogen deficiency observed in comets.},

However, such data provide only an indirect and model-dependent method of finding central holes. Imaging of protoplanetry disks provides an independent check of SED modeling. We present here the direct characterization of three 33-47 AU radii inner gaps, in the disks around LkHalpha 330, SR 21N, and HD 135344B, via 340 GHz (880 mum) dust continuum aperture synthesis observations obtained with the Submillimeter Array (SMA). The large gaps are fully resolved at {\textasciitilde}0farcs3 by the SMA data and mostly empty of dust, with less than (1-7.5) {\texttimes} 10-6 M
sun of fine grained solids inside the holes. Gas (as traced by atomic accretion markers and CO 4.7 mum rovibrational emission) is still present in the inner regions of all three disks. For each, the inner hole exhibits a relatively steep rise in dust emission to the outer disk, a feature more likely to originate from the gravitational influence of a companion body than from a process expected to show a more shallow gradient like grain growth. Importantly, the good agreement between the spatially resolved data and spectrophotometry-based models lends confidence to current interpretations of SEDs, wherein the significant dust emission deficits arise from disks with inner gaps or holes. Further SED-based searches can therefore be expected to yield numerous additional candidates that can be examined at high spatial resolution.},

  abstract = {The formation of gaseous giant planets is thought to occur in the first few million years after stellar birth. Models predict that the process produces a deep gap in the dust component (shallower in the gas). Infrared observations of the disk around the young star HD 142527 (at a distance of about 140 parsecs from Earth) found an inner disk about 10 astronomical units (AU) in radius (1 AU is the Earth-Sun distance), surrounded by a particularly large gap and a disrupted outer disk beyond 140 AU. This disruption is indicative of a perturbing planetary-mass body at about 90 AU. Radio observations indicate that the bulk mass is molecular and lies in the outer disk, whose continuum emission has a horseshoe morphology. The high stellar accretion rate would deplete the inner disk in less than one year, and to sustain the observed accretion matter must therefore flow from the outer disk and cross the gap. In dynamical models, the putative protoplanets channel outer-disk material into gap-crossing bridges that feed stellar accretion through the inner disk. Here we report observations of diffuse CO gas inside the gap, with denser HCO+ gas along gap-crossing filaments. The estimated flow rate of the gas is in the range of 7 {\texttimes} 10-9 to 2 {\texttimes} 10-7 solar masses per year, which is sufficient to
maintain accretion onto the star at the present rate.},

  abstract = {Continuum observations at 1.3 mm of 86 pre-main sequence stars in the Taurus-Auriga dark clouds show that 42\% have detectable emission from small particles. The detected fraction is only slightly smaller for the weak-line and "naked" T Tauri stars than for classical T Tauris, indicating that the former stars often have circumstellar material. In both categories, the column densities of particles are too large to be compatible with spherical distributions of circumstellar matter -- the optical extinctions would be too large; the particles are almost certainly in spatially thin, circumstellar disks. Models of the spectral energy distributions from 10 to 1300 \ensuremath{\mu}m indicate that for the most part the disks are transparent at 1.3 mm, although the
innermost (\ensuremath{\ll}1 AU) regions are opaque even at millimeter wavelenths. The aggregate particle masses are between 10-5 and
10-2 M\ensuremath{\odot}. The disk mass does not decrease with increasing stellar age up to at least 107 years among the stars detected at 1.3 mm. There is some evidence for temperature evolution, in the sense that older disks are colder and less luminous. There is little correlation between disk mass and H\ensuremath{\alpha} equivalent
width among the detected stars, suggesting that the H\ensuremath{\alpha} line is not by itself indicative of disk mass. Spectral indices for several sources between 1.3 and 2.7 mm suggest that the particle emissivities \ensuremath{\varepsilon}
are weaker functions of frequency \ensuremath{\nu} than is the usual case of
interstellar grains. Particle growth via adhesion in the dense disks might explain this result. The typical disk has an angular momentum comparable to that generally accepted for the early solar nebula, but very little stored energy, almost five orders of magnitude smaller than that of the central star. Our results demonstrate that disks more massive than the minimum mass of the proto-solar system commonly accompany the birth of solar-mass stars and suggest that planetary systems are common in the Galaxy.},

  abstract = {We present a high angular resolution millimeter-wave dust continuum 
imaging survey of circumstellar material associated with the individual
components of 23 multiple star systems in the Taurus-Auriga young
cluster. Combined with previous measurements in the literature, these
new data permit a comprehensive look at how the millimeter luminosity (a
rough tracer of disk mass) relates to the separation and mass of a
stellar companion. Approximately one-third (28\%-37\%) of the individual
stars in multiple systems have detectable millimeter emission, an
incidence rate half that for single stars ({\textasciitilde}62\%) which does not depend
on the number of companions. There is a strong, positive correlation
between the luminosity and projected separation (ap ) of a
stellar pair. Wide pairs (ap \ensuremath{>} 300 AU) have a similar
luminosity distribution as single stars, medium pairs (ap
\ensuremath{\approx} 30-300 AU) are a factor of five fainter, and close pairs
(ap \ensuremath{<} 30 AU) are {\textasciitilde}5{\texttimes} fainter yet (aside from a
small, but notable population of bright circumbinary disks). In most
cases, the emission is dominated by a disk around the primary (or a wide
tertiary in hierarchical triples), but there is no clear relationship
between luminosity and stellar mass ratio. A direct comparison of
resolved disk sizes with predictions from tidal truncation models yields
mixed results; some disks are much larger than expected given the
projected distances of their companions. We suggest that the presence of
a stellar companion impacts disk properties at a level comparable to the
internal evolution mechanisms that operate in an isolated system, with
both the multiple star formation process itself and star-disk tidal
interactions likely playing important roles in the evolution of
circumstellar material. From the perspective of the mass content of the
disk reservoir, we expect that (giant) planet formation is inhibited
around the components of close pairs or secondaries, but should be as
likely as for single stars around the primaries (or wide tertiaries in
hierarchical triples) in more widely separated multiple star systems.},

arising from a circumstellar disk around T Tau N, and estimate its
properties by fitting a flat-disk model to visibilities at \ensuremath{\lambda} = 1

probability distributions are calculated for values of the free
parameters, including the temperature, density, dust opacity, and disk
outer radius. The radial variation in temperature and density is not
narrowly constrained by the data. The most likely value of the frequency
dependence of the dust opacity,
\ensuremath{\beta}=0.53+0.27-0.17, is consistent with that of
disks around other single T Tauri stars in which grain growth is
believed to have taken place. The outer radius,
R=41+26-14 AU, is smaller than the projected
separation between T Tau N and T Tau S, and may indicate tidal or
resonance truncation of the disk by T Tau S. The total mass estimated
for the disk, log (MD/M\ensuremath{\odot}) =
-2.4+0.7-0.6, is similar to masses observed around
many single pre-main-sequence sources and, within the uncertainties, is
similar to the minimum nebular mass required to form a planetary system
like our own. This observation strongly suggests that the presence of a
binary companion does not rule out the possibility of formation of a
sizable planetary system.},

opacities of the CO isotopomers to sample the temperature disk structure
at various vertical scales inside the disk. Typically, the
12CO transitions are sampling at 2-4 scale heights, while the
13CO data are more likely tracing 1 scale height for the
J=2-1, and the disk mid-plane for the J=1-0 line. At the disk scale at
which the IRAM observations are sensitive (R\ensuremath{>}= 50-60 AU), the
analysis reveals a vertical temperature gradient. The outer layers where
tau (12CO J=2 -\ensuremath{>} 1) ={\textasciitilde} 1 are warmer (\{ {\textasciitilde} \} 30 K) than
the inner layers probed by 13CO and C18O data (\{ {\textasciitilde}

the outer radius of the disk is smaller in 13CO and

163296 at {\textasciitilde}2'' (250 AU) resolution, and interpret these data in the
framework of a model that constrains the radial and vertical location of
the line emission regions. First, we develop a physically
self-consistent accretion disk model with an exponentially tapered edge
that matches the spectral energy distribution and spatially resolved
millimeter dust continuum emission. Then, we refine the vertical
structure of the model using wide range of excitation conditions sampled
by the CO lines, in particular the rarely observed J = 6-5 transition.
By fitting 13CO data in this structure, we further constrain
the vertical distribution of CO to lie between a lower boundary below
which CO freezes out onto dust grains (T \ensuremath{<}{\textasciitilde} 19 K) and an upper
boundary above which CO can be photodissociated (the hydrogen column
density from the disk surface is \ensuremath{<}{\textasciitilde} 1021 cm-2).
The freezeout at 19 K leads to a significant drop in the gas-phase CO
column density beyond a radius of {\textasciitilde}155 AU, a "CO snow line" that we
directly resolve. By fitting the abundances of all CO isotopologues, we
derive isotopic ratios of 12C/13C,
16O/18O, and 18O/17O that
are consistent with quiescent interstellar gas-phase values. This
detailed model of the HD 163296 disk demonstrates the potential of a
staged, parametric technique for constructing unified gas and dust
structure models and constraining the distribution of molecular

Typically, we reach an internal precision of 10\% in the determinations
of stellar mass. The overall accuracy is limited by the uncertainty in
the distance to a specific star. In a distance-independent way, we
compare the derived masses with theoretical tracks of pre-main-sequence
evolution. Combined with the mean distance to the Taurus region (140
pc), for stars with mass close to 1 Msolar, our results tend
to favor the tracks with cooler photospheres (higher masses for a given

complement the six sources in the Taurus star-forming region reported
previously. CO 2-1 and HCO+ 3-2 emission are detected and
resolved in all disks and show velocity patterns consistent with
Keplerian rotation. Where detected, the emission from DCO+
3-2, N2H+ 3-2, H2CO 30 3 -
20 2 and 41 4 - 31 3, HCN 3-2, and CN

while the F star SAO 206462 has only weak CN and HCN emission, and
H2CO alone is detected toward HD 142527. These findings
together with the statistics from the previous Taurus disks support the
hypothesis that high detection rates of many small molecules depend on
the presence of a cold and protected disk midplane, which is less common
around F and A stars compared to M and K stars. Disk-averaged variations
in the proposed radiation tracer CN/HCN are found to be small, despite a
two orders of magnitude range of spectral types and accretion rates. In
contrast, the resolved images suggest that the CN/HCN emission ratio
varies with disk radius in at least two of the systems. There are no
clear observational differences in the disk chemistry between the
classical/full T Tauri disks and transitional disks. Furthermore, the
observed line emission does not depend on the measured accretion
luminosities or the number of infrared lines detected, which suggests
that the chemistry outside of 100 AU is not coupled to the physical
processes that drive the chemistry in the innermost few AU.},

in their evolution that can have a considerable impact on the formation
and early development of planetary systems. We present new and archival
high angular resolution (0farcs3 \ensuremath{\approx} 40-75 AU) Submillimeter Array
(SMA) observations of the 880 mum (340 GHz) dust continuum emission
from 12 such transition disks in nearby star-forming regions. In each
case, we directly resolve a dust-depleted disk cavity around the central
star. Using two-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative transfer calculations,
we interpret these dust disk structures in a homogeneous, parametric
model framework by reproducing their SMA continuum visibilities and
spectral energy distributions. The cavities in these disks are large (R
cav = 15-73 AU) and substantially depleted of small
({\textasciitilde}mum-sized) dust grains, although their mass contents are still
uncertain. The structures of the remnant material at larger radii are
comparable to normal disks. We demonstrate that these large cavities are
relatively common among the millimeter-bright disk population,
comprising at least 1 in 5 (20\%) of the disks in the bright half (and
\ensuremath{>}=26\% of the upper quartile) of the millimeter luminosity (disk mass)
distribution. Utilizing these results, we assess some of the physical
mechanisms proposed to account for transition disk structures. As has
been shown before, photoevaporation models do not produce the large
cavity sizes, accretion rates, and disk masses representative of this
sample. A sufficient decrease of the dust optical depths in these
cavities by particle growth would be difficult to achieve: substantial
growth (to meter sizes or beyond) must occur in large (tens of AU)
regions of low turbulence without also producing an abundance of small
particles. Given those challenges, we suggest instead that the
observations are most commensurate with dynamical clearing due to tidal
interactions with low-mass companions---very young ({\textasciitilde}1 Myr) brown

HCO+ and HCN lines up to J=4-\ensuremath{>}3, are detected from the
disks around LkCa 15 and TW Hya. These lines originate from levels with
higher excitation temperatures and critical densities than studied
before. Combined with interferometer data on lower excitation lines, the
line ratios can be used to constrain the physical structure of the disk.
The different line ratios and optical depths indicate that most of the
observed line emission arises from an intermediate disk layer with high
densities of 106-108 cm-3 and
moderately warm temperatures in the outer regions. The data are compared
with three different disk models from the literature using a full 2D
Monte Carlo radiative transfer code. The abundances of the molecules are
constrained from the more optically thin 13C species and
indicate depletions of {\textasciitilde}1-30 for LkCa 15 and very high depletions of
\ensuremath{>}100 for TW Hya with respect to dark cloud abundances. Evidence for
significant freeze-out (factors of 10 or larger) of CO and
HCO+ onto grain surfaces at temperatures below 22 K is found,
but the abundances of these molecules must also be low in the warmer
upper layer, most likely as a result of photodissociation. A warm upper
layer near the surface of a flaring disk heated by stellar and
interstellar radiation is an appropriate description of the observations
of TW Hya. LkCa 15 seems to be cooler at the surface, perhaps due to
dust settling. The density constraints are also well fitted by the
flared disk models.},

circumstellar disks around young stellar objects. In the Z-direction,
the disk can be schematically divided into three layers: the midplane,
the outermost surface region, and the intermediate region. On the
midplane, in cool outer regions of a disk, most of the molecules are
adsorbed onto grains within a short time and depleted from the gas phase
owing to the high density. As the height Z increases, the density
decreases and the time scale for adsorption of molecules onto the dust
particles increases. At the outermost surface regions, on the other
hand, molecules are dissociated by UV radiation. Hence, in disks with a
typical age (105-10\^{}6 yr), molecular abundances have their
peak values at some intermediate region. The height at which the
abundances reach their peak values varies with species. Radicals, such
as CN and C\_2H, have their peaks at larger heights Z than more stable
species such as HCN and NH\_3. At significant distances from the
midplane, the chemistry is also affected by a higher ionization rate due
to X-rays, if the central star is a strong X-ray emitter, while, in the
midplane, cosmic-rays are the main sources of ionization. The abundances
of some species (e.g. HCN) are enhanced by a higher ionization rate.
Integrating molecular abundances perpendicular to the midplane, we
obtain column densities for molecules, and their radial distribution.
Column densities of selected molecules such as HNC and NH\_3 are
particularly sensitive to the total column density of the disk and the
variation in UV radiation field due to the growth and sedimentation of
dust particles. Our results show reasonable agreement with molecular
abundances in the DM Tau disk estimated from radio observations.},

the IRAM array of the disks surrounding MWC 480, LkCa 15, and DM Tau,
and simultaneous measurements of HCO+ J = 1--\ensuremath{>} 0. To
derive the disk properties, we fit a standard disk model in which all
parameters are power laws of the distance to the star to the data.
Possible biases associated with the method are detailed and explained.
We compare the properties of the observed disks with similar objects.
Results: We find evidence for a vertical temperature gradient in
the disks of MWC 480 and DM Tau,
as in AB Aur, but not in LkCa 15.
The disk temperatures increase with stellar effective temperature.
Except for AB Aur, the bulk of the CO gas is at
temperatures smaller than 17 K, below the condensation temperature on
grains. We find the scale height of the CO distribution to be larger (by
50\%) than the expected hydrostatic scale height. The total amount of CO
and the isotopologue ratio depends globally on the star. The more UV
luminous objects appear to have more CO, but there is no simple
dependency. The {[} 13CO] /{[} HCO\^{}+] ratio is {\textasciitilde}600, with
substantial variations between sources, and with radius. The temperature
behavior is consistent with expectations, but published chemical models
have difficulty reproducing the observed CO quantities. Changes in the
slope of the surface density distribution of CO, compared to the
continuum emission, suggest a more complex surface density distribution
than is usually assumed in models. Vertical mixing seems an important
chemical agent, as does photo-dissociation by the ambient UV radiation
at the disk's outer edge.},

  abstract = {The finding of residual gas in the large central cavity of the HD142527 
disk motivates questions on the origin of its non-Keplerian kinematics,
and possible connections with planet formation. We aim to understand the
physical structure that underlies the intra-cavity gaseous flows, guided
by new molecular-line data in CO(6-5) with unprecedented angular
resolutions. Given the warped structure inferred from the identification
of scattered-light shadows cast on the outer disk, the kinematics are
consistent, to first order, with axisymmetric accretion onto the inner
disk occurring at all azimuth. A steady-state accretion profile, fixed
at the stellar accretion rate, explains the depth of the cavity as
traced in CO isotopologues. The abrupt warp and evidence for near
free-fall radial flows in HD 142527 resemble theoretical models for disk
tearing, which could be driven by the reported low mass companion, whose
orbit may be contained in the plane of the inner disk. The companion's
high inclination with respect to the massive outer disk could drive
Kozai oscillations over long time-scales; high-eccentricity periods may
perhaps account for the large cavity. While shadowing by the tilted disk
could imprint an azimuthal modulation in the molecular-line maps,
further observations are required to ascertain the significance of
azimuthal structure in the density field inside the cavity of HD142527.},

fields will distort the appearance of radiation emitted near the black
hole. Radio observations at wavelengths of 3.5mm and 7mm have detected
intrinsic structure in SgrA*, but the spatial resolution of observations
at these wavelengths is limited by interstellar scattering. Here we
report observations at a wavelength of 1.3mm that set a size of
microarcseconds on the intrinsic diameter of SgrA*. This is less than
the expected apparent size of the event horizon of the presumed black
hole, suggesting that the bulk of SgrA* emission may not be centred on

Nonimaging algorithms are developed that use interferometric closure quantities to test for periodicity, and applied to an ensemble of hot spot models that sample a range of parameter space. We find that structural periodicity in a wide range of cases can be detected on most potential VLBI arrays using modern VLBI instrumentation. Future enhancements of millimeter/submillimeter VLBI arrays including phased-array processors to aggregate VLBI station collecting area, increased bandwidth recording, and addition of new VLBI sites all significantly aid periodicity detection.

At 1.4 mm, dust continuum emission of about 750 AU in extent is associated with GG Tau, and a secondary peak is near GG Tau/c. Spectral line images reveal gaseous structure around GG Tau, elongated along the GG Tau-GG Tau/c axis. There is some suggestion that the gas associated with GG Tau/c alone is extended in a different direction. Marked changes in the morphology and velocity structure of the molecular emission near GG Tau/c also indicate that this system is differently oriented. Clumps between the two systems may be vestiges of a connecting bar.

deuterated molecular species in circumstellar disks around young stellar
objects. The abundance ratios between singly deuterated and normal
molecules (``D/H ratios'') in disks evolve in a similar way as in
molecular clouds. Fractionation is caused by rapid exchange reactions
that are exothermic because of energy differences between deuterated and
normal species. In the midplane region, where molecules are heavily
depleted onto grain surfaces, the D/H ratios of gaseous molecules are
higher than at larger heights. The D/H ratios for the vertical column
densities of NH3, H2O, and HCO+ are
sensitive to the temperature, and decrease significantly with decreasing
radial distance for R \ensuremath{<}{\textasciitilde} 300 AU. The analogous D/H ratios for
CH4 and H2CO, on the other hand, are not very
sensitive to the temperature in the range (T=10-50 K) we are concerned
with, and do not decrease with decreasing R at R\ensuremath{>}= 50 AU. The D/H
column-density ratios also depend on disk mass. In a disk with a larger
mass, the ratios of deuterated species to normal species are higher,
because of heavier depletion of molecules onto grains. In the second
part of the paper, we report molecular column densities for disks
embedded in ambient cloud gas. Our results suggest that CN and
HCO+ can be tracers of gaseous disks, especially if the
central object is a strong X-ray source. Our results also suggest that
the radial distributions of CN, C2H, HCN, and H2CO
may vary among disks depending on the X-ray luminosity of the central

black hole at the center of the giant elliptical galaxy M87 powers a relativistic jet. Observations at millimeter wavelengths with the Event Horizon Telescope have localized the emission from the base of this jet to angular scales comparable to the putative black hole horizon. The jet might be powered directly by an accretion disk or by electromagnetic extraction of the rotational energy of the black hole. However, even the latter mechanism requires a confining thick accretion disk to maintain the required magnetic flux near the black hole. Therefore, regardless of the jet mechanism, the observed jet power in M87 implies a certain minimum mass accretion rate. If the central compact object in M87 were not a black hole but had a surface, this accretion would result in considerable thermal near-infrared and optical emission from the surface. Current flux limits on the nucleus of M87 strongly constrain any such surface emission. This rules out the presence of a surface and thereby provides indirect evidence for an event horizon.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations 
have expanded and improved our understanding of the dynamics of
black-hole accretion disks. However, current simulations do not capture
the thermodynamics of electrons in the low density accreting plasma.
This poses a significant challenge in predicting accretion flow images
and spectra from first principles. Because of this, simplified emission
models have often been used, with widely different configurations (e.g.,
disk- versus jet-dominated emission), and were able to account for the
observed spectral properties of accreting black holes. Exploring the
large parameter space introduced by such models, however, requires
significant computational power that exceeds conventional computational
facilities. In this paper, we use GRay, a fast graphics processing unit
(GPU) based ray-tracing algorithm, on the GPU cluster El Gato, to
compute images and spectra for a set of six general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamic simulations with different magnetic field
configurations and black-hole spins. We also employ two different
parametric models for the plasma thermodynamics in each of the
simulations. We show that, if only the spectral properties of Sgr A* are
used, all 12 models tested here can fit the spectra equally well.
However, when combined with the measurement of the image size of the
emission using the Event Horizon Telescope, current observations rule
out all models with strong funnel emission, because the funnels are
typically very extended. Our study shows that images of accretion flows
with horizon-scale resolution offer a powerful tool in understanding
accretion flows around black holes and their thermodynamic properties.},

studies of the subhorizon-scale structure for a handful of supermassive

the Milky Way, Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), presents the largest angular
cross section. Thus far, these studies have focused on measurements of
the black hole spin and the validation of low-luminosity accretion
models. However, a critical input in the analysis of EHT data is the
structure of the black hole spacetime, and thus these observations
provide the novel opportunity to test the applicability of the Kerr
metric to astrophysical black holes. Here we present the first simulated
images of a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) around Sgr A*
employing a quasi-Kerr metric that contains an independent quadrupole
moment in addition to the mass and spin that fully characterize a black
hole in general relativity. We show that these images can be
significantly different from the images of an RIAF around a Kerr black
hole with the same spin and demonstrate the feasibility of testing the
no-hair theorem by constraining the quadrupolar deviation from the Kerr
metric with existing EHT data. Equally important, we find that the disk
inclination and spin orientation angles are robust to the inclusion of
additional parameters, providing confidence in previous estimations
assuming the Kerr metric based on EHT observations. However, at present,
the limits on potential modifications of the Kerr metric remain weak.},

we assume that an optically thick region for synchrotron self-absorption

\{\vphantom{\}}\{U\}B\vphantom{\{}\}\ensuremath{\backslash}gg \{\vphantom{\}}\{U\}+/- \vphantom{\{}\} is realized in this case. We
further examine the composition of plasma and energy density of protons

novel capacity to probe the emission region of a handful of supermassive
black holes on sub-horizon scales. For Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the
supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, this provides
access to the region in the immediate vicinity of the horizon. Broderick
et al. have already shown that by leveraging spectral and polarization
information as well as accretion theory, it is possible to extract
accretion-model parameters (including black hole spin) from mm-VLBI
experiments containing only a handful of telescopes. Here we repeat this
analysis with the most recent mm-VLBI data, considering a class of
aligned, radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) models. We find
that the combined data set rules out symmetric models for Sgr A*'s flux
distribution at the 3.9sigma level, strongly favoring length-to-width
ratios of roughly 2.4:1. More importantly, we find that physically
motivated accretion flow models provide a significantly better fit to
the mm-VLBI observations than phenomenological models, at the 2.9sigma
level. This implies that not only is mm-VLBI presently capable of
distinguishing between potential physical models for Sgr A*'s emission,
but further that it is sensitive to the strong gravitational lensing
associated with the propagation of photons near the black hole. Based
upon this analysis we find that the most probable magnitude, viewing

2. Future very long baseline interferometric (VLBI)
observations will image a bright and narrow ring surrounding the shadow
of a supermassive black hole, if its accretion flow is optically thin.
In this paper, we explore the prospects of reducing the correlation
between mass and distance with the combination of dynamical measurements
and VLBI imaging of the ring of Sgr A*. We estimate the signal-to-noise
ratio of near-future VLBI arrays that consist of five to six stations,
and we simulate measurements of the mass and distance of Sgr A* using
the expected size of the ring image and existing stellar ephemerides. We
demonstrate that, in this best-case scenario, VLBI observations at 1 mm
can improve the error on the mass by a factor of about two compared to
the results from the monitoring of stellar orbits alone. We identify the
additional sources of uncertainty that such imaging observations have to
take into account. In addition, we calculate the angular diameters of
the bright rings of other nearby supermassive black holes and identify
the optimal targets besides Sgr A* that could be imaged by a
ground-based VLBI array or future space-VLBI missions allowing for

Isoradial curves corresponding to photons emitted at constant radius from the hole as seen by a distant observer in an arbitrary direction have been plotted, as well as spectral shifts arising from gravitational and Doppler shifts. The results of Page and Thorne (1974) show that the relative intrinsic intensity of radiation emitted by the disk at a given radius is a known function of the radius only, so that it is possible to calculate the exact distribution of observed bolometric flux. Direct and secondary images are plotted. Strong asymmetry in the flux distribution due to the rotation of the disk is exhibited.

images of black holes within a framework that allows us to calculate
observables in the electromagnetic spectrum as a function of the mass,
spin, and, independently, the quadrupole moment of a black hole. We show
that a deviation of the quadrupole moment from the expected Kerr value
leads to images of black holes that are either prolate or oblate
depending on the sign and magnitude of the deviation. In addition, there
is a ring-like structure around the black hole shadow with a diameter of
{\textasciitilde}10 black hole masses that is substantially brighter than the image of
the underlying accretion flow and that is independent of the
astrophysical details of accretion flow models. We show that the shape
of this ring depends directly on the mass, spin, and quadrupole moment
of the black hole and can be used for an independent measurement of all
three parameters. In particular, we demonstrate that this ring is highly
circular for a Kerr black hole with a spin a \ensuremath{<}{\textasciitilde} 0.9 M, independent of
the observer's inclination, but becomes elliptical and asymmetric if the
