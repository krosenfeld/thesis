  abstract = {The statistics of discovered exoplanets suggest that planets form efficiently. However, there are fundamental unsolved problems, such as excessive inward drift of particles in protoplanetary disks during planet formation. Recent theories invoke dust traps to overcome this problem. We report the detection of a dust trap in the disk around the star Oph IRS 48 using observations from the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The
0.44-millimeter-wavelength continuum map shows high-contrast
crescent-shaped emission on one side of the star, originating from millimeter-sized grains, whereas both the mid-infrared image
(micrometer-sized dust) and the gas traced by the carbon monoxide 6-5 rotational line suggest rings centered on the star. The difference in distribution of big grains versus small grains/gas can be modeled with a vortex-shaped dust trap triggered by a companion.},

release in protostellar systems for decades. HD 163296 is a Herbig Ae
star surrounded by a disk and has been shown to host a series of HH
knots (HH 409) with bow shocks associated with the farthest knots. Here
we present ALMA science verification data of CO J = 2-1 and J = 3-2
emission, which are spatially coincident with the blue shifted jet of HH
knots, and offset from the disk by -18.6 km s-1. The emission
has a double corkscrew morphology and extends more than 10'' from the
disk with embedded emission clumps coincident with jet knots. We
interpret this double corkscrew as emission from material in a molecular
disk wind, and that the compact emission near the jet knots is being
heated by the jet that is moving at much higher velocities. We show that
the J = 3-2 emission is likely heavily filtered by the interferometer,
but the J = 2-1 emission suffers less due to the larger beam and
sensitivity to larger scale structures. Excitation analysis suggests
temperatures exceeding 900 K in these compact features, with the wind
mass, momentum and energy being of order 10-5
M\&sun;, 10-4 M\&sun; km s-1

that this star is dispersing the disk faster than it is funneling mass
onto the star.},

are truncated at an outer radius are incapable of reproducing both the

dust continuum emission is always significantly smaller than the extent
of the molecular gas disk traced by CO emission. However, a simple model
motivated by similarity solutions of the time evolution of accretion
disks that includes a tapered exponential edge in the surface density
distribution (and the same number of free parameters) does much better
at reproducing both the gas and dust emission. While this analysis does
not rule out the disparate radii implied by the truncated power law
models, a realistic alternative disk model, grounded in the physics of
accretion, provides a consistent picture for the extent of both the gas

imaging survey of circumstellar material associated with the individual
components of 23 multiple star systems in the Taurus-Auriga young
cluster. Combined with previous measurements in the literature, these
new data permit a comprehensive look at how the millimeter luminosity (a
rough tracer of disk mass) relates to the separation and mass of a
stellar companion. Approximately one-third (28\%-37\%) of the individual
stars in multiple systems have detectable millimeter emission, an
incidence rate half that for single stars ({\textasciitilde}62\%) which does not depend
on the number of companions. There is a strong, positive correlation
between the luminosity and projected separation (ap ) of a
stellar pair. Wide pairs (ap \ensuremath{>} 300 AU) have a similar
luminosity distribution as single stars, medium pairs (ap
\ensuremath{\approx} 30-300 AU) are a factor of five fainter, and close pairs
(ap \ensuremath{<} 30 AU) are {\textasciitilde}5{\texttimes} fainter yet (aside from a
small, but notable population of bright circumbinary disks). In most
cases, the emission is dominated by a disk around the primary (or a wide
tertiary in hierarchical triples), but there is no clear relationship
between luminosity and stellar mass ratio. A direct comparison of
resolved disk sizes with predictions from tidal truncation models yields
mixed results; some disks are much larger than expected given the
projected distances of their companions. We suggest that the presence of
a stellar companion impacts disk properties at a level comparable to the
internal evolution mechanisms that operate in an isolated system, with
both the multiple star formation process itself and star-disk tidal
interactions likely playing important roles in the evolution of
circumstellar material. From the perspective of the mass content of the
disk reservoir, we expect that (giant) planet formation is inhibited
around the components of close pairs or secondaries, but should be as
likely as for single stars around the primaries (or wide tertiaries in
hierarchical triples) in more widely separated multiple star systems.},

from the optically thick 13CO J = 3-2 emission. The lower
limit of the peak surface density was then calculated to be 28 g

This finding implies that the region is locally too massive to withstand
self-gravity, since Toomre's Q lesssim; 1-2, and thus it may collapse
into a gaseous protoplanet. Another possibility is that the gas mass is
low enough to be gravitationally stable, and only dust grains are

scattered light) that extends to a much larger radius of at least 215
AU. We discuss some possible explanations for the observed radial
distribution of millimeter-sized dust grains and the apparent CO-dust

emission unveils for the first time at submillimeter frequencies the
vertical structure details of a gaseous disk in Keplerian rotation,
showing the back and front sides of a flared disk. Continuum emission at

surface brightness profile that shows a very steep decline at radius
larger than 125 AU. The gaseous disk is more than two times larger than
the dust disk, with a similar critical radius but with a shallower
radial profile. Radiative transfer models of the continuum data confirm
the need for a sharp outer edge to the dust disk. The models for the
CO(3-2) channel map require the disk to be slightly more geometrically

transition discs LkHalpha 330, SR 21N and HD 1353444B at submillimetre

axisymmetric disc. We show that a large-scale anticyclonic vortex that
develops where the viscosity has a large gradient (e.g. at the edge of
the disc dead zone), might be accountable for these large-scale
asymmetries. We modelled the long-term evolution of vortices being
triggered by the Rossby wave instability. We found that a
horseshoe-shaped (azimuthal wavenumber m = 1) large-scale vortex forms
by coalescing of smaller vortices within 5 {\texttimes} 104 yr,
and can survive on the disc lifetime ({\texttildelow}5 {\texttimes} 106
yr), depending on the magnitude of global viscosity and the thickness of
the viscosity gradient. The two-dimensional grid-based global disc
simulations with local isothermal approximation and compressible-gas
model have been done by the GPU version of hydrodynamic code FARGO
(GFARGO). To calculate the dust continuum image at submillimetre
wavelengths, we combined our hydrodynamical results with a
three-dimensional radiative transfer code. By the striking similarities
of the calculated and observed submillimetre images, we suggest that the
three transition discs can be modelled by a disc possessing a
large-scale vortex formed near the disc dead zone edge. Since the larger

the non-axisymmetric submillimetre images of the above transition discs

of the Herbig Ae star HD 163296 obtained with the IRAM/PBI, SMA and VLA
arrays both in continuum and in the 12CO, 13CO and
C18O emission lines. Gas and dust properties have been
obtained comparing the observations with self-consistent disk models for
the dust and CO emission. The circumstellar disk is resolved both in the
continuum and in CO. We find strong evidence that the circumstellar
material is in Keplerian rotation around a central star of 2.6 M\_\&sun;.
The disk inclination with respect to the line of sight is 46{\textdegree}
\ensuremath{\pm} 4{\textdegree} with a position angle of 128{\textdegree} \ensuremath{\pm} 4{\textdegree}. The
slope of the dust opacity measured between 0.87 and 7 mm (beta = 1)
confirms the presence of mm/cm-size grains in the disk midplane. The
dust continuum emission is asymmetric and confined inside a radius of
200 AU while the CO emission extends up to 540 AU. The comparison
between dust and CO temperature indicates that CO is present only in the
disk interior. Finally, we obtain an increasing depletion of CO
isotopomers from 12CO to 13CO and C18O.
We argue that these results support the idea that the disk of HD 163296
is strongly evolved. In particular, we suggest that there is a strong
depletion of dust relative to gas outside 200 AU; this may be due to the
inward migration of large bodies that form in the outer disk or to
clearing of a large gap in the dust distribution by a low mass
companion.

accretion disk, and (2) the radiative transfer models developed by
D'Alessio et al. that can reproduce the dust emission probed by the

protoplanetary disks, regulating the mass accretion process, the
transport of angular momentum, and the growth of dust particles. 
Aims: We intend to determine the magnitude of the turbulent motions in
the outer parts (\ensuremath{>}100 AU) of the disk surrounding DM Tau. 
Methods: Turbulent motions can be constrained by measuring the
nonthermal broadening of line emission from heavy molecules. We used the
IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer to study emission from the CS
molecule in the disk of DM Tau. High spatial (1.4 {\texttimes} 11.4 {\texttimes} 1
farcs) and spectral resolution (0.126 km s-1) CS J = 3-2
images provide constraints on the molecule distribution and velocity
structure of the disk. A low sensitivity CS J = 5-4 image was used in
conjunction to evaluate the excitation conditions. We analyzed the data
in terms of two parametric disk models, and compared the results with
detailed time-dependent chemical simulations. Results: The CS
data confirm the relatively low temperature suggested by observations of
other simple molecules. The intrinsic linewidth derived from the CS J =
3-2 data is much larger than expected from pure thermal broadening. The
magnitude of the derived nonthermal component depends only weakly on
assumptions about the location of the CS molecules with respect to the
disk plane. Our results indicate turbulence with a Mach number around
0.4-0.5 in the molecular layer. Geometrical constraints suggest that
this layer is located near one scale height, in reasonable agreement
with chemical model predictions.

  abstract = {Context. Planet formation is closely related to the structure and 
dispersal of protoplanetary disks. A certain class of disks, called
transition disks, exhibit cavities in dust images at scales of up to a
few 10s of AU. The formation mechanism of the cavities is still unclear.
The gas content of such cavities can be spatially resolved for the first
time using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Aims: We develop a new series of models to simulate the physical
conditions and chemical abundances of the gas in cavities to address the
question whether the gas is primarily atomic or molecular inside the
dust free cavities exposed to intense UV radiation. Molecular/atomic
line emission by carbon monoxide (CO), its isotopologues
(13CO, C18O, C17O, and
13C18O) and related species ({[}C i], {[}C ii], and {[}O
i]) is predicted for comparison with ALMA and the Herschel Space
Observatory. Methods: We use a thermo-chemical model, which
calculates the radiative transfer both in lines and the continuum, and
solves for the chemical abundances and gas temperature. The model is
based on our previous work, but includes several improvements. We study
the dependence of CO abundances and lines on several parameters such as
gas mass in the cavity, disk mass and luminosity of the star. 
Results: The gas can remain in molecular form down to very low amounts
of gas in the cavity ({\textasciitilde}1\% of MEarth). Shielding of the
stellar radiation by a dusty inner disk ("pre-transition disk") allows
CO to survive down to lower gas masses in the cavity. The column
densities of H2 and CO in the cavity scale almost linearly
with the amount of gas in the cavity down to the mass where
photodissociation becomes important. The main parameter for the CO
emission from cavity is the gas mass. Other parameters such as the outer
disk mass, bolometric luminosity, shape of the stellar spectrum or PAH
abundance are less important. Since the CO pure rotational lines readily
become optically thick, the CO isotopologues need to be observed in
order to quantitatively determine the amount of gas in the cavity.
Determining gas masses in the cavity from atomic lines ({[}C i], {[}C ii],
and {[}O i]) is challenging. Conclusions: A wide range of gas
masses in the cavity of transition disks ({\textasciitilde}4 orders of magnitude) can be
probed using combined observations of CO isotopologue lines with ALMA.
Measuring the gas mass in the cavity will ultimately help to distinguish
between different cavity formation theories.

and possible connections with planet formation. We aim to understand the
physical structure that underlies the intra-cavity gaseous flows, guided
by new molecular-line data in CO(6-5) with unprecedented angular
resolutions. Given the warped structure inferred from the identification
of scattered-light shadows cast on the outer disk, the kinematics are
consistent, to first order, with axisymmetric accretion onto the inner
disk occurring at all azimuth. A steady-state accretion profile, fixed
at the stellar accretion rate, explains the depth of the cavity as
traced in CO isotopologues. The abrupt warp and evidence for near
free-fall radial flows in HD 142527 resemble theoretical models for disk
tearing, which could be driven by the reported low mass companion, whose
orbit may be contained in the plane of the inner disk. The companion's
high inclination with respect to the massive outer disk could drive
Kozai oscillations over long time-scales; high-eccentricity periods may
perhaps account for the large cavity. While shadowing by the tilted disk
could imprint an azimuthal modulation in the molecular-line maps,
further observations are required to ascertain the significance of
azimuthal structure in the density field inside the cavity of HD142527.},

  abstract = {Spatially resolved observations of molecular line emission have the 
potential to yield unique constraints on the nature of turbulence within
protoplanetary disks. Using a combination of local non-ideal
magnetohydrodynamic simulations and radiative transfer calculations,
tailored to properties of the disk around HD 163296, we assess the
ability of ALMA to detect turbulence driven by the magnetorotational
instability (MRI). Our local simulations show that the MRI produces
small-scale turbulent velocity fluctuations that increase in strength
with height above the mid-plane. For a set of simulations at different
disk radii, we fit a Maxell-Boltzmann distribution to the turbulent
velocity and construct a turbulent broadening parameter as a function of
radius and height. We input this broadening into radiative transfer
calculations to quantify observational signatures of MRI-driven disk
turbulence. We find that the ratio of the peak line flux to the flux at
line center is a robust diagnostic of turbulence that is only mildly
degenerate with systematic uncertainties in disk temperature. For the
CO(3-2) line, which we expect to probe the most magnetically active
slice of the disk column, variations in the predicted peak-to-trough
ratio between our most and least turbulent models span a range of
approximately 15\%. Additional independent constraints can be derived
from the morphology of spatially resolved line profiles, and we estimate
the resolution required to detect turbulence on different spatial
scales. We discuss the role of lower optical depth molecular tracers,
which trace regions closer to the disk mid-plane where velocities in
MRI-driven models are systematically lower.},

constrained. Field strengths have been inferred on T Tauri stars and possibly in the innermost part of their accretion disks, but the strength and morphology of the field in the bulk of a disk have not been observed. Spatially unresolved measurements of polarized emission (arising from elongated dust grains aligned perpendicularly to the field) imply average fields aligned with the disks. Theoretically, the fields are expected to be largely toroidal, poloidal or a mixture of the two, which imply different mechanisms for transporting angular momentum in the disks of actively accreting young stars such as HL Tau (ref. 11). Here we report resolved measurements of the polarized 1.25-millimetre continuum emission from the disk of HL Tau. The magnetic field on a scale of 80 astronomical units is coincident with the major axis (about 210 astronomical units long) of the disk. From this we conclude that the magnetic field inside the disk at this scale cannot be dominated by a vertical component, though a purely toroidal field also does not fit the data well. The unexpected morphology suggests that the role of the magnetic field in the accretion of a T Tauri star is more complex than our current theoretical understanding.},

some degree of grain growth and evolution. Additional clues that the

  abstract = {The identification of on-going planet formation requires the finest 
angular resolutions and deepest sensitivities in observations inspired
by state-of-the-art numerical simulations. Hydrodynamic simulations of
planet-disk interactions predict the formation of circumplanetary disks
(CPDs) around accreting planetary cores. These CPDs have eluded
unequivocal detection -their identification requires predictions in CPD
tracers. In this work, we aim to assess the observability of embedded
CPDs with ALMA as features imprinted in the gas kinematics. We use 3D
Smooth Particle Hydrodynamic (SPH) simulations of CPDs around 1 and 5
M\_Jup planets at large stellocentric radii, in locally isothermal and
adiabatic disks. The simulations are then connected with 3D radiative
transfer for predictions in CO isotopologues. Observability is assessed
by corrupting with realistic long baseline phase noise extracted from
the recent HL Tau ALMA data. We find that the presence of a CPD produces
distinct signposts: 1) compact emission separated in velocity from the
overall circumstellar disk's Keplerian pattern, 2) a strong impact on
the velocity pattern when the Doppler shifted line emission sweeps
across the CPD location, and 3) a local increase in the velocity
dispersion. We test our predictions with a simulation tailored for HD
100546 -which has a reported protoplanet candidate. We find that the
CPDs are detectable in all 3 signposts with ALMA Cycle 3 capabilities
for both 1 and 5 M\_Jup protoplanets, when embedded in an isothermal

spawned our planetary system was rich in water and organic molecules.
Bombardment brought these organics to the young Earth's surface. Unlike
asteroids, comets preserve a nearly pristine record of the solar nebula
composition. The presence of cyanides in comets, including 0.01 per cent
of methyl cyanide (CH3CN) with respect to water, is of
special interest because of the importance of C-N bonds for abiotic
amino acid synthesis. Comet-like compositions of simple and complex
volatiles are found in protostars, and can readily be explained by a
combination of gas-phase chemistry (to form, for example, HCN) and an
active ice-phase chemistry on grain surfaces that advances complexity.
Simple volatiles, including water and HCN, have been detected previously
in solar nebula analogues, indicating that they survive disk formation
or are re-formed in situ. It has hitherto been unclear whether the same
holds for more complex organic molecules outside the solar nebula, given
that recent observations show a marked change in the chemistry at the
boundary between nascent envelopes and young disks due to accretion
shocks. Here we report the detection of the complex cyanides
CH3CN and HC3N (and HCN) in the protoplanetary
disk around the young star MWC 480. We find that the abundance ratios of
these nitrogen-bearing organics in the gas phase are similar to those in
comets, which suggests an even higher relative abundance of complex
cyanides in the disk ice. This implies that complex organics accompany
simpler volatiles in protoplanetary disks, and that the rich organic
chemistry of our solar nebula was not unique.},

2.9-to-3.6-micrometer range present across the entire illuminated
surface are compatible with opaque minerals associated with nonvolatile
organic macromolecular materials: a complex mixture of various types of
carbon-hydrogen and/or oxygen-hydrogen chemical groups, with little
contribution of nitrogen-hydrogen groups. In active areas, the changes
in spectral slope and absorption feature width may suggest small amounts
of water-ice. However, no ice-rich patches are observed, indicating a
generally dehydrated nature for the surface currently illuminated by the

  abstract = {Context. Transitional disks with large dust cavities are important 
laboratories in which to study planet formation and disk evolution. Cold
gas may still be present inside these cavities, but quantying this gas
is challenging. The gas content is important for constraining the origin
of the dust cavity. Aims: We use Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of 12CO
6-5 and 690 GHz (Band 9) continuum of five well-studied transitional
disks. In addition, we analyze previously published Band 7 observations
of a disk in the 12CO 3-2 line and 345 GHz continuum. The
observations are used to set constraints on the gas and dust surface
density profiles, in particular, the drop deltagas of the
gas density inside the dust cavity. Methods: The
physical-chemical modeling code DALI was used to simultaneously analyze
the gas and dust images. We modeled SR21, HD 135344B, LkCa15, SR24S, and
RX J1615-3255 (Band 9) and J1604-2130 (Band 7). The spectral energy
distribution and continuum visibility curve constrain the dust surface
density. Then we used the same model to calculate the 12CO
emission, which we compared with the observations through spectra and
intensity cuts. The amount of gas inside the cavity was quantified by
varying the deltagas parameter. Results: Model fits
to the dust and gas indicate that gas is still present inside the dust
cavity for all disks, but at a reduced level. The gas surface density
drops inside the cavity by at least a factor 10, while the dust density
drops by at least a factor 1000. Disk masses are comparable with
previous estimates from the literature, cavity radii are found to be
smaller than in the data obtained with the 345 GHz SubMillimeter Array.
 Conclusions: The derived gas surface density profiles suggest
that the cavity was cleared by one or more companions in all cases,
which trapped the millimeter-sized dust at the edge of the cavity.

millimeter-sized dust grains, is qualitatively consistent with the
predictions of pressure trap models that include hydrodynamical
disk-planet interactions and dust coagulation/fragmentation processes.},

a small dust disk could be attributed to initial formation conditions, outward truncation by an unseen companion, or dust evolution in the disk. Notably, the dust distribution of IRAS 04125+2902 resembles a narrow ring (DeltaR {\textasciitilde} 35 AU) composed of large dust grains at the location of the disk wall. Such narrow dust rings are also seen in other transitional disks and may be evidence of dust trapping in pressure bumps, possibly produced by planetary companions. More sensitive submillimeter observations of the gas are necessary to further probe the physical mechanisms at work in shaping the spatial distribution of large dust in this disk. Interestingly, the IRAS 04125+2902 disk is
significantly fainter than other transitional disks that have been resolved at submillimeter wavelengths, hinting that more objects with large disk holes may exist at the faint end of the submillimeter luminosity distribution that await detection with more sensitive imaging telescopes.},

HCN and its
isotopologues are particularly clear tracers of planetary heating for the models considered here, and emission from multiple transitions of the same species is detectable, which encodes temperature information in addition to possible velocity information from the spectra itself.

  abstract = {Theory predicts that giant planets and low mass stellar companions shape circumstellar disks by opening annular gaps in the gas and dust spatial distribution. For more than a decade it has been debated whether this is the dominant process that leads to the formation of transitional disks. In this paper, we present millimeter-wave interferometric observations of the transitional disk around the young intermediate mass star LkHalpha 330. These observations reveal a lopsided ring in the 1.3 mm dust thermal emission characterized by a radius of about 100 AU and an azimuthal intensity variation of a factor of two. By comparing the observations with a Gaussian parametric model, we find that the observed asymmetry is consistent with a circular arc, that extends azimuthally by about 90{\textdegree} and emits about 1/3 of the total continuum flux at 1.3 mm. Hydrodynamic simulations show that this structure is similar to the azimuthal asymmetries in the disk surface density that might be produced by the dynamical interaction with unseen low mass companions orbiting within 70 AU from the central star. We argue that such asymmetries might lead to azimuthal variations in the millimeter-wave dust opacity and in the dust temperature, which will also affect the millimeter-wave continuum emission. Alternative explanations for the observed asymmetry that do not require the presence of companions cannot be ruled out with the existing data. Further observations of both the dust and molecular gas emission are required to derive firm conclusions on the origin of the asymmetry observed in the LkHalpha 330 disk.},

Dust traps caused by gas pressure maxima have been proposed as regions where grains can concentrate and grow fast enough to form planetesimals, before radially migrating onto the star. We report new VLA Ka \& Ku observations of the
protoplanetary disk around the Herbig Ae/Be star MWC 758. The Ka image shows a compact emission region in the outer disk indicating a strong concentration of big dust grains. Tracing smaller grains, archival ALMA data in band 7 continuum shows extended disk emission with an intensity maximum to the north-west of the central star, which matches the VLA clump position. This segregation of grains sizes is expected in the context of dust trapping, where big grains are trapped more easily than smaller grains in gas pressure maxima. We develop a non-axisymmetric parametric model inspired by a steady state vortex solution which reproduces the observations, including the spectral energy distribution. Finally, we compare the radio continuum with SPHERE scattered light data. The ALMA continuum spatially coincides with a region devoid of scattered polarised emission and the VLA clump is offset to the north of the north-western spiral-like feature, indicating moderate or no flaring in the outer disk.},

respectively; therefore multi-wavelength observations could help
elucidate the origin of complicated structures of a disk. Here we report
Submillimeter Array observations of the dust continuum at 1.3 mm and
12CO J = 2 --\ensuremath{>} 1 line emission of the pre-transitional
protoplanetary disk around the solar-mass star PDS 70. PDS 70, a

larger gap in the disk with a radius of {\textasciitilde}80 AU at 1.3 mm. Emission from
all three disk components (the gas and the small and large dust grains)
in images exhibits a deficit in brightness in the central region of the
disk, in particular, the dust disk in small and large dust grains has
asymmetric brightness. The contrast ratio of the flux density in the
dust continuum between the peak position to the opposite side of the

the disk around PDS 70 are potentially formed by several (unseen)

  abstract = {A pathway to the formation of planetesimals, and eventually giant 
planets, may occur in concentrations of dust grains trapped in pressure
maxima. Dramatic crescent-shaped dust concentrations have been seen in
recent radio images at sub-mm wavelengths. These disk asymmetries could
represent the initial phases of planet formation in the dust trap
scenario, provided that grain sizes are spatially segregated. A testable
prediction of azimuthal dust trapping is that progressively larger
grains should be more sharply confined and furthermore the trapped
grains should follow a distribution that is markedly different from the
gas. However, gas tracers such as CO and the infrared emission from
small grains are both very optically thick where the submm continuum
originates, so observations have been unable to test the trapping
predictions or to identify compact concentrations of larger grains
required for planet formation by core-accretion. Here we report
multifrequency observations of HD142527, from 34GHz to 700GHz, that
reveal a compact concentration of {\textasciitilde}cm-sized grains, with a few Earth
masses, embedded in a large-scale crescent of {\textasciitilde}mm-sized particles. The
emission peaks at wavelengths shorter than {\textasciitilde}1mm are optically thick and
trace the temperature structure resulting from shadows cast by the inner
regions. Given this temperature structure, we infer that the largest
dust grains are concentrated in the 34 GHz clump. We conclude that dust
trapping is efficient for approximately cm-sized grains and leads to
enhanced concentrations, while the smaller grains largely reflect the
gas distribution.},

HCO+ (1-0), (3-2) and DCO+ (3-2) with a {\textasciitilde} 1.5'' angular and {\textasciitilde}0.2 km s-1 spectral resolution. Using a
power-law fitting approach the observed column densities profiles are derived and thus the isotopic ratio RD =
DCO+/HCO+. Chemical modelling allowed an
exploration of the sensitivity of HCO+ and DCO+ abundances to physical parameters out with temperature. A steady state approximation was employed to observationally constrain the ionization fraction x(e-). Results: Fitting of radiative transfer models suggests that there is a chemical hole in HCO+ and DCO+, extending up to 50 AU from the star. More work is required to discern the cause of this. The observed column densities of HCO+ and DCO+ at 100 AU were
(9.8+0.3-0.7) {\texttimes} 1012 and (1.2
\ensuremath{\pm} 0.7) {\texttimes} 1012 cm-2 respectively.
Where both HCO+ and DCO+ were present,
RD was found to increase radially from 0.1 at 50 AU to 0.2 at 450 AU. This behaviour was well reproduced by the chemical model. The X-ray luminosity of the central star, the interstellar UV and CO depletion were found to be the most important physical parameters controlling the abundances of HCO+ and DCO+. Differences in the vertical extent of HCO+ and
DCO+ molecular layers resulted in different responses to changing physical parameters, manifesting as radial gradients in RD. The ionization fraction was found to be x(e-) {\textasciitilde} 10-7 in the molecular layer, comparable to the disk averaged value. Modelling shows that while HCO+ is the most dominant charged molecular ion in our disk model, atomic ions, such as C+, S+, H+, Na+ and
Mg+, dominate the charge in both the molecular layer and disk atmosphere. Conclusions: A high value of RD is indicative of continued deuterium fractionation in a protoplanetary disk after pre/protostellar phases. Radial properties of RD can be employed to discern the importance of ionization from X-rays and UV, thus necessitating the need for more, high resolution observations of DCO+ and other deuterated species in disks. A steady-state approach commonly adopted for constraining ionization degree in
prestellar cores is not applicable for disks where accurate
determination of the ionization fraction in the molecular layer requires knowledge of the atomic ions present as molecular ions are relatively sparse.

  abstract = {The chemical properties of protoplanetary disks are especially sensitive 
to their ionization environment. Sources of molecular gas ionization
include cosmic rays (CRs), stellar X-rays, and short-lived
radionuclides, each of which varies with location in the disk. This
behavior leads to a significant amount of chemical structure, especially
in molecular ion abundances, which is imprinted in their submillimeter
rotational line emission. Using an observationally motivated disk model,
we make predictions for the dependence of chemical abundances on the
assumed properties of the ionizing field. We calculate the emergent line
intensity for abundant molecular ions and simulate sensitive
observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/Sub-millimeter Array
(ALMA) for a disk at D = 100 pc. The models readily distinguish between
high ionization rates (zeta \ensuremath{>}{\textasciitilde} 10-17 s-1 per
H2) and below, but it becomes difficult to distinguish
between low ionization models when zeta \ensuremath{<}{\textasciitilde} 10-19
s-1. We find that H2D+ emission is not
detectable for sub-interstellar CR rates with ALMA (6h integration), and
that N2D+ emission may be a more sensitive tracer
of midplane ionization. HCO+ traces X-rays and high CR rates
(zetaCR \ensuremath{>}{\textasciitilde} 10-17 s-1), and
provides a handle on the warm molecular ionization properties where CO
is present in the gas. Furthermore, species like HCO+, which
emits from a wide radial region and samples a large gradient in
temperature, can exhibit ring-like emission as a consequence of
low-lying rotational level de-excitation near the star. This finding
highlights a scenario where rings are not necessarily structural or
chemical in nature, but simply a result of the underlying line
excitation properties.},

  abstract = {Context. Circumstellar disks are considered to be the birthplace of planets. Specific structures like spiral arms, gaps, and cavities are characteristic indicators of planet-disk interaction. Investigating these structures can provide insights into the growth of protoplanets and the physical properties of the disk. Aims: We investigate the feasibility of using molecular lines to trace planet-induced structures in circumstellar disks. Methods: Based on 3D hydrodynamic simulations of planet-disk interactions obtained with the PLUTO code, we perform self-consistent temperature calculations and produce N-LTE molecular line velocity-channel maps and spectra of these disks using our new N-LTE line radiative transfer code Mol3D. Subsequently, we simulate ALMA observations using the CASA simulator. We consider two nearly face-on inclinations, five disk masses, seven disk radii, and two different typical pre-main-sequence host stars (T Tauri, Herbig Ae) at a distance of 140 pc. We calculate up to 141 individual velocity-channel maps for five molecules/isotopoloques (12C16O, 12C18O, HCO+, HCN, and CS) in a total of 32 rotational transitions to investigate the frequency dependence of the structures indicated above. Results: We find that the majority of protoplanetary disks in our parameter space could be detected in the molecular lines considered. However, unlike the
continuum case, gap detection is not straightforward in lines. For example, gaps are not seen in symmetric rings but are masked by the pattern caused by the global (Keplerian) velocity field. By comparison with simulated observations of undisturbed disks we identify specific regions in the velocity-channel maps that are characteristic of
planet-induced structures. Conclusions: Simulations of high angular resolution molecular line observations demonstrate the potential of ALMA to provide complementary information about the planet-disk interaction as compared to continuum observations. In particular, the detection of planet-induced gaps is possible under certain conditions.

  abstract = {Context. Transitional disks are circumstellar disks with dust gaps 
thought to be related in some cases to planet formation. They can shed
light on the planet formation process by the analysis of their gas and
dust properties. T Cha is a young star surrounded by a transitional disk
with signatures of planet formation. Aims: The aim of this work
is to spatially resolve the outer disk around T Cha and to derive its
main properties. Methods: We have obtained high-resolution and
high-sensitivity ALMA observations in the CO(3-2), 13CO(3-2),
and CS(7-6) emission lines to reveal the spatial distribution of the
gaseous disk around the star. In order to study the dust within the disk
we have also obtained continuum images at 850 mum from the line-free
channels. Results: We have spatially resolved the outer disk
around T Cha. Using the CO(3-2) emission we derive a radius of {\textasciitilde}230 AU.
We also report the detection of the 13CO(3-2) and the CS(7-8)
molecular emissions, which show smaller radii than the CO(3-2)
detection. The continuum observations at 850 mum allow the spatial
resolution of the dusty disk, which shows two emission bumps separated
by {\textasciitilde}40 AU, consistent with the presence of a dust gap in the inner
regions of the disk, and an outer radius of {\textasciitilde}80 AU. Therefore, T Cha is
surrounded by a compact dusty disk and a larger and more diffuse gaseous
disk, as previously observed in other young stars. The continuum
intensity profiles are different at both sides of the disk suggesting
possible dust asymmetries. We derive an inclination of i({\textdegree}) = 67
\ensuremath{\pm} 5, and a position angle of PA({\textdegree}) = 113 \ensuremath{\pm} 6, for both
the gas and dust disks. The comparison of the ALMA data with radiative
transfer models shows that the gas and dust components can only be
simultaneously reproduced when we include a tapered edge prescription
for the surface density profile. The best model suggests that most of
the disk mass is placed within a radius of R\ensuremath{<} 50 AU. Finally, we
derive a dynamical mass for the central object of M* =
1.5 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.2 M\&sun;, comparable to the one estimated with
evolutionary models for an age of {\textasciitilde}10 Myr.},

around single stars. In a close binary star (with a separation of less
than a hundred astronomical units), theory predicts the presence of
circumstellar disks around each star, and an outer circumbinary disk
surrounding a gravitationally cleared inner cavity around the stars.
Given that the inner disks are depleted by accretion onto the stars on
timescales of a few thousand years, any replenishing material must be
transferred from the outer reservoir to fuel planet formation (which
occurs on timescales of about one million years). Gas flowing through
disk cavities has been detected in single star systems. A circumbinary
disk was discovered around the young low-mass binary system GG Tau A
(ref. 7), which has recently been shown to be a hierarchical triple
system. It has one large inner disk around the single star, GG Tau Aa,
and shows small amounts of shocked hydrogen gas residing within the
central cavity, but other than a single weak detection, the distribution
of cold gas in this cavity or in any other binary or multiple star
system has not hitherto been determined. Here we report imaging of gas
fragments emitting radiation characteristic of carbon monoxide within
the GG Tau A cavity. From the kinematics we conclude that the flow
appears capable of sustaining the inner disk (around GG Tau Aa) beyond
the accretion lifetime, leaving time for planet formation to occur
there. These results show the complexity of planet formation around
multiple stars and confirm the general picture predicted by numerical
simulations.},

fronts of abundant volatile species. Specifically, we show that the
prominent innermost dip at 13 AU is spatially resolved in the 0.87 mm

condensation front of water ice. In addition, two other prominent dips,
at distances of 32 and 63 AU, cover the mid-plane condensation fronts of
pure ammonia or ammonia hydrates and clathrate hydrates (especially with
CO and N2) formed from amorphous water ice. The spectral
index map of HL Tau between 1.3 and 0.87 mm shows that the flux ratios
inside the dips are statistically larger than those of nearby regions in
the disk. This variation can be explained by a model with two dust
populations, where most of the solid mass resides in a component that
has grown to decimeter size scales inside the dips. Such growth is in
accord with recent numerical simulations of volatile condensation, dust
coagulation, and settling.},

morphology. Based on a model in which the C2H column density follows a truncated radial power-law distribution, we find that the inner edge of the ring lies at {\textasciitilde}45 AU, and that the ring extends to at least {\textasciitilde}120 AU. Comparison with previous (single-dish)
observations of C2H N=4\ensuremath{\backslash}to 3 emission indicates that the C2H molecules are subthermally excited and, hence, that the emission arises from the relatively warm (T\ensuremath{\greaterequivlnt} 40 K), tenuous (n\ensuremath{\backslash}ll \{\vphantom{\}}\{10\}7\vphantom{\{}\} cm-3) upper atmosphere of the disk. Based on these results and comparisons of the SMA C2H map with previous submillimeter and scattered-light imaging, we propose that the C2H emission most likely traces particularly efficient photo-destruction of small grains and/or photodesorption and
photodissociation of hydrocarbons derived from grain ice mantles in the surface layers of the outer disk. The presence of a C2H ring in the TW Hya disk hence likely serves as a marker of dust grain processing and radial and vertical grain size segregation within the disk.},

small dust grains inside a radius of up to several 10s of AUs. Owing to
the lack of angular resolution and sensitivity, the gas content of these
dust holes has not yet been determined, but is of importance for
constraining the mechanism leading to the dust holes. It is thought that
transition disks are currently undergoing the process of dispersal,
setting an end to the giant planet formation process. Aims: We
present new high-resolution observations with the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) of gas lines towards the
transition disk Oph IRS 48 previously shown to host a large dust trap.
The ALMA telescope has detected the J = 6-5 line of 12CO and
C17O around 690 GHz (434 mum) at a resolution of {\textasciitilde}0.25''
corresponding to {\textasciitilde}30 AU (FWHM). The observed gas lines are used to set
constraints on the gas surface density profile. Methods: New
models of the physical-chemical structure of gas and dust in Oph IRS 48
are developed to reproduce the CO line emission together with the
spectral energy distribution and the VLT-VISIR 18.7 mum dust continuum
images. Integrated intensity cuts and the total spectrum from models
having different trial gas surface density profiles are compared to
observations. The main parameters varied are the drop in gas surface
density inside the dust-free cavity with a radius of 60 AU and inside
the gas-depleted innermost 20 AU. Using the derived surface density
profiles, predictions for other CO isotopologues are made, which can be
tested by future ALMA observations of the object. Results: From
the ALMA data we find a total gas mass of the disk of 1.4 {\texttimes}
10-4 M\&sun;. This gas mass yields a gas-to-dust
ratio of {\textasciitilde}10, but with considerable uncertainty. Inside 60 AU, the gas
surface density drops by a factor of {\textasciitilde}12 for an assumed surface density
slope of gamma = 1 (Sigma \ensuremath{\propto} r-gamma). Inside 20
AU, the gas surface density drops by a factor of at least 110. The drops
are measured relative to the extrapolation to small radii of the surface
density law at radii \ensuremath{>}60 AU. The inner radius of the gas disk at 20
AU can be constrained to better than \ensuremath{\pm}5 AU. Conclusions:
The derived gas surface density profile points to the clearing of the
cavity by one or more massive planets/companions rather than just
photoevaporation or grain-growth.

significant deviations from Keplerian motion that has been interpreted
as evidence for a disk wind, also displays significant deviations from
Keplerian disk emission in the observations presented here. Detections
near both AS 205 N and S are obtained in 1.3 mm continuum,
12CO 2-1, 13CO 2-1, and C18O 2-1. The
12CO emission is extended up to {\textasciitilde}2'' from AS 205 N, and both
12CO and 13CO display deviations from Keplerian
rotation at all angular scales. Two possible explanations for these
observations hold up best to close scrutiny---tidal interaction with
AS 205 S or disk winds (or a combination of the two)---and we
discuss these possibilities in some detail.},

  abstract = {We present Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of a wide binary system in Orion, with projected separation 440 AU, in which we detect submillimeter emission from the
protoplanetary disks around each star. Both disks appear moderately massive and have strong line emission in CO 3-2, HCO+ 4-3, and HCN 3-2. In addition, CS 7-6 is detected in one disk. The
line-to-continuum ratios are similar for the two disks in each of the lines. From the resolved velocity gradients across each disk, we constrain the masses of the central stars, and show consistency with optical-infrared spectroscopy, both indicative of a high mass ratio {\textasciitilde}9. The small difference between the systemic velocities indicates that the binary orbital plane is close to face-on. The angle between the
projected disk rotation axes is very high, {\textasciitilde}72{\textdegree}, showing that the system did not form from a single massive disk or a rigidly rotating cloud core. This finding, which adds to related evidence from disk geometries in other systems, protostellar outflows, stellar rotation, and similar recent ALMA results, demonstrates that turbulence or dynamical interactions act on small scales well below that of molecular cores during the early stages of star formation.},

By forward-modeling the disk velocity field traced by CO J = 2--1 line emission, we infer the mass of the central binary,
\{M\}*=2.49+/- 0.10 \{M\}o , a new dynamical
measurement that is independent of stellar evolutionary models. Assuming the disk and binary are co-planar within {\textasciitilde}2{\textdegree}, this disk-based
binary mass measurement is in excellent agreement with constraints from radial velocity monitoring of the combined stellar spectra. These ALMA results are also compared with the standard approach of estimating masses from the location of the binary in the Hertzsprung--Russell diagram, using several common pre-MS model grids. These models predict stellar masses that are marginally consistent with our dynamical measurement (at {\textasciitilde}2sigma), but are systematically high (by
{\textasciitilde}10\%). These same models consistently predict an age of 18 \ensuremath{\pm}
1 Myr for AK Sco, in line with its membership in the Upper
Centaurus--Lupus association but surprisingly old for it to still host a gas-rich disk. As ALMA accumulates comparable data for large samples of pre-MS stars, the methodology employed here to extract a dynamical mass from the disk rotation curve should prove extraordinarily useful for efforts to characterize the fundamental parameters of early stellar evolution.},

holes, which power galactic nuclei by converting the gravitational

compact source of radio, infrared and X-ray emission at the centre of
the Milky Way, is the closest example of this phenomenon, with an
estimated black hole mass that is 4,000,000 times that of the Sun. A
long-standing astronomical goal is to resolve structures in the
innermost accretion flow surrounding SgrA*, where strong gravitational
fields will distort the appearance of radiation emitted near the black
hole. Radio observations at wavelengths of 3.5mm and 7mm have detected
intrinsic structure in SgrA*, but the spatial resolution of observations
at these wavelengths is limited by interstellar scattering. Here we
report observations at a wavelength of 1.3mm that set a size of
microarcseconds on the intrinsic diameter of SgrA*. This is less than
the expected apparent size of the event horizon of the presumed black
hole, suggesting that the bulk of SgrA* emission may not be centred on
the black hole, but arises in the surrounding accretion flow.},

We survey the potential of millimeter wavelength very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) to detect and constrain time-variable structures that could give rise to such variations, focusing on a model in which an orbiting hot spot is embedded in an accretion disk. Nonimaging algorithms are developed that use interferometric closure quantities to test for periodicity, and applied to an ensemble of hot spot models that sample a range of parameter space. We find that structural periodicity in a wide range of cases can be detected on most potential VLBI arrays using modern VLBI instrumentation. Future enhancements of millimeter/submillimeter VLBI arrays including phased-array processors to aggregate VLBI station collecting area, increased bandwidth recording, and addition of new VLBI sites all significantly aid periodicity detection. The methods described herein can be applied to other models of Sagittarius A*, including jet outflows and magnetohydrodynamic accretion simulations.},

  abstract = {Aims: Recent observations by the Atacama Large 
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) of disks around young stars
revealed distinct asymmetries in the dust continuum emission. In this
work we wish to study axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric structures that
are generated by the magneto-rotational instability in the outer regions
of protoplanetary disks. We combine the results of state-of-the-art
numerical simulations with post-processing radiative transfer (RT) to
generate synthetic maps and predictions for ALMA. Methods: We
performed non-ideal global 3D magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) stratified
simulations of the dead-zone outer edge using the FARGO MHD code PLUTO.
The stellar and disk parameters were taken from a parameterized disk
model applied for fitting high-angular resolution multi-wavelength
observations of various circumstellar disks. We considered a stellar
mass of M\ensuremath{_\ast} = 0.5 M\ensuremath{\odot} and a total disk
mass of about 0.085 M\ensuremath{_\ast}. The 2D initial temperature and
density profiles were calculated consistently from a given surface
density profile and Monte Carlo radiative transfer. The 2D Ohmic
resistivity profile was calculated using a dust chemistry model. We
considered two values for the dust-to-gas mass ratio, 10-2
and 10-4, which resulted in two different levels of magnetic
coupling. The initial magnetic field was a vertical net flux field. The
radiative transfer simulations were performed with the Monte Carlo-based
3D continuum RT code MC3D. The resulting dust reemission provided the
basis for the simulation of observations with ALMA. Results: All
models quickly turned into a turbulent state. The fiducial model with a
dust-to-gas mass ratio of 10-2 developed a large gap followed
by a jump in surface density located at the dead-zone outer edge. The
jump in density and pressure was strong enough to stop the radial drift
of particles at this location. In addition, we observed the generation
of vortices by the Rossby wave instability at the jump location close to
60 AU. The vortices were steadily generated and destroyed at a cycle of
40 local orbits. The RT results and simulated ALMA observations predict
that it is feasible to observe these large-scale structures that appear
in magnetized disks without planets. Neither the turbulent fluctuations
in the disk nor specific times of the model can be distinguished on the
basis of high-angular resolution submillimeter observations alone. The
same applies to the distinction between gaps at the dead-zone edges and
planetary gaps, to the distinction between turbulent and simple
unperturbed disks, and to the asymmetry created by the vortex.},
